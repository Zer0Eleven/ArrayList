1. Loading the array

  First, add a variable and name it whatever you'd like. I recommend naming it "array".
  After you add the variable, You need to define it. After you define it, your code should be like this:

  local array = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zer0Eleven/ArrayList/main/main.lua"))()

  
2. Adding stuff
  
  There are 4 functions, array.Add, array.Remove, array.Color, and array.Font. First, use array.Add to add an item!

  heres how to use array.Add:
  
  array.Add("Speed", "CFrame")

  Second, use array.Remove to remove an item! (Make sure that you've used array.Add to add the item you want to remove

  Example: array.Remove("Speed")
  
  Third, use array.Color to set the color of the array to whatever you want (RGB), You can also use array.Color to make your own rainbow array!

  Example: array.Color(255, 255, 255)
  
  Fourth, use array.Font to set the font of the array! (Make sure its a font supported by Roblox)

  Example: array.Font(Enum.Font.Ubuntu)
